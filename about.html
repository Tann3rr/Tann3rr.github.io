        <p>I'm a starter level Java developer, I mostly do it for fun.</p>
        <p>I may not be very good at Java, but I'm pretty much self-taught since I can't be asked to take a course (maybe one day).</p>
        <p>I started out mostly scripting in batch, Windows default language aka CMD.</p>
